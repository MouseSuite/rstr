\item{quiet}{logical; if \code{FALSE} does not display messages to the user}

\description{
This script reads from and writes to the setup configuration file (rstr.ini) for rstr.
Usually this will be called automatically when the package is installed and loaded
for the first time. Optionally, it can be executed by the user immediately after installing rstr.
